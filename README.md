# Session : 10

## Objective

- Use Faker library to get 10000 random profiles. Using namedtuple, calculate the largest blood type, mean-current_location, oldest_person_age and average age (add proper doc-strings). - 250

- Do the same thing above using a dictionary. Prove that namedtuple is faster. - 250

- Create a fake data (you can use Faker for company names) for imaginary stock exchange for top 100 companies (name, symbol, open, high, close). Assign a random weight to all the   companies. Calculate and show what value stock market started at, what was the highest value during the day and where did it end. Make sure your open, high, close are not     totally random. You can only use namedtuple. - 500

- Write a test file, that tests all of the functions mentioned above + the other basic ones 
- Test file must contain at least 1 tests for each function
